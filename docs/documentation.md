# Documentation

Documentation is how we call the manuals, reference material and sometimes even examples of code. There is no shame in consulting documentation. It's always a good thing to have it open when you are coding: Expert developers keep it next to them all the time.

Here is a list of useful documentation websites:

- [Pixel Turtle Library]({{ '/pixel-turtle' | relative_url }})
- [Pixel Kit Library]({{ '/pixel-kit' | relative_url }})
- [Programming in Python: Variables, Conditions, Repetition and Functions]({{ '/programming-in-python' | relative_url }})
- [MicroPython](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/quickref.html) (even the microprocessor on the Pixel Kit is the ESP32, the documentation is pretty much the same as for the ESP8266)
- [Python 3 official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html) (this one is the real deal)
