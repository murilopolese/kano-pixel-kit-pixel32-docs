Follow this video instructions to learn how to:

- Load a module renaming it with `import` and  `as`
- Set the heading color with `setHeadingColor()`
- Generate a random number and take decisions based on it.
- Make the turtle never go offscreen by making it appear on the opposite side of the screen using the `%` (modulo) operator. Check [this tutorial](https://www.journaldev.com/15651/python-modulo), [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Iy3v1co0A) or [this other video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5cb_nfDyyM) on how to use it (the internet is full of them).
- Tweak the decisions in order to get different types of random walks.
