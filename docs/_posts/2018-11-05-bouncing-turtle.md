Follow this video instructions to learn how to:

- Find out which direction turtle is going using `getHeading()`
- Run a piece of code forever using `while True`
- Add a sleep to the end of the code that will repeat forever will allow it to be stopped without having to restart the Pixel Kit.
- Check if a value is in array with `in`
- Create conditions with many statements using `and` and `or`
- Break line to improve readability on condition statements using `\`
- Get random numbers using `randint`
