This video is a bit fast paced so if you are having trouble to follow you can pause, slow down the reproduction speed, examine carefully the code and try it yourself (this is the most important part!).

Follow this video instructions to learn how to:

- Detect different types of collisions between the "ball" and walls, bricks and pad.
- Identify where is the "ball" coming from when the collision is detected to allow different bouncing behaviors.
- Isolate the complicated math and logic on functions with descriptive names to make easier to read the code.
